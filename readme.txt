I am using both Homework Tokens on this assignment, I really
struggled with this assignment because I was having problems 
creating the tabs but after some hard work I finally figured
out how to display them.

I have Modified my page to validate all data entered by the user using the
jQuery Validation plugin and I have also added the sliders and the tab 
functions to the page with jQuery-UI. I have tested my page thoroughly and I believe I
have handled each possibility. I was unable to style the tabs mult table for some reason.
